!!! warning Work in progress
Dear user,

Thank you for your time. I am doing my best to make Docarys useful and meaningful. However, both documentation and docarys itself is under heavy development.

I promise you to give my best to introduce the minimum required breaking changes. Also, to keep the documentation as much up to date and complete as possible.

If you also find Docarys interesting, useful and meaningful, and you can contribute in any way (Issues or Pull Requests), your help is more than welcome.

Sincerely yours,

Sergio and the Docarys team
!!!

## Overview

Welcome to docarys. Docarys is:

* A Node.JS port of the popular and amazing, python-based [MKDocs][1] by Tom Christie.
* An adaptation of the great [Material for MKDocs][2] theme by Martin Donath

This means that docarys is also a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation.

Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

Also, if you are a front-end or Node.JS developer, you have all the tools you need to start creating amazing documentation for your project.

## Why a port to NodeJS

I think that documentation is a huge technical debt for developers, and traditional approaches are not working. Documentation solutions (at least for developers) should be easy to write and integrated with the workflows and tools we, the developers, are used to use.

This way, I found the amazing MKDocs. BUT, I didn't like the idea to have to install python just to document...

Also, should admit that I really love the new [Microsoft docs][3], which is a font of inspiration for some current (and future) features.

And last but not least, I wanted to learn some Node.JS.

So, why don't contribute to documentation tooling landscape? How fast and easy would be to create a port?

docarys is the result.
